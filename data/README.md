## DATA

Data was transferred from the path /Volumes/Expansion/2022-utexas-OchmcompPOD/projects/2021_pafl_metaG/data/qc-seqs/ to the path /workdir/myb7/data/MuskegonLake/qc_seqs/ via Filezilla

Samples were numbered from 91614 to 91629. Each sample had five flow cell lanes, numbered from 3 to 7. Two reads were taken from each cell lane, for a total of 160 reads stored in fastq files. Each flow cell lane also had an interleaved fastq.gz file containing its two reads, for a total of 80 interleaved files. In total, 240 files were transferred.

Fastq files were run through md5sum to verify data integrity.
