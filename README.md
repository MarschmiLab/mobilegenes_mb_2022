## Abstract
Mobile genetic elements (MGE) are the major driver of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which allows bacteria to acquire new traits that enable them to adapt to their environment. In aquatic systems, heterotrophic bacteria strongly influence  the carbon cycle as they can consume up to 50% of the carbon fixed by phytoplankton. The composition of freshwater bacterial communities consists of two interconnected groups: particle-associated bacteria and free-living bacteria, each having their own unique lifestyle and metabolic functions. Since particle environments are rich in nutrients compared to the free water, particle-associated bacteria grow by attaching to the particle surface and forming dense, multi-species communities with high rates per-capita growth and likely increased cell-cell interaction. However, the extent of the presence of MGEs among particle-associated and free-living bacterial communities still remains unclear. Here, we searched for MGEs from freshwater microbial communities within a drowned river mouth Muskegon Lake (Muskegon, MI), which connects to Lake Michigan, one of the worldâ€™s largest freshwater bodies. We assembled and annotated high throughput metagenomic sequencing data to identify mobile genetic elements within these two contrasting communities. We predict there are higher frequencies of MGEs in particle-associated communities in comparison to their free-living counterparts due to increased cell density that allow for more opportunities for HGT. These results will add to our understanding of the impact of MGEs towards the acquisition of adaptive traits such as antibiotic resistance among freshwater bacteria.
